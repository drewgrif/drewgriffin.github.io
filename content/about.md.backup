I was born in the old St. Joseph Hospital in Tampa, FL. I am a fourth generation Tampa native and very proud of that fact.

I am 57 years old now. I have the great fortune to own the title of  “dad”. To me, it is without question the greatest thing I have done in my life.

On January 30, 2010, DeeDee Brinkman and I were married in a small gathering of friends and family.

I still work for an Internet Company that owns and operates many very popular web destinations.  I am blessed with a terrific family and the type of friends that most people wish they had.

Most people who I haven’t seen in a while ask me two or three questions which brings them up to speed. Let me elaborate.

**Stats:** Married, with an 20 year old son, Jack. My mom still lives in Temple Terrace.

**Health:**  I am doing well.  At my peak, I weighed in about 237 lbs.  Now, I am sub-200 on a good day.  Most days are good.  My goal is to get get down to about 185.  

**Sports:**  Now that I am in my 50s, I think it prudent to not play.  That doesn't mean I can't be active, but the last time I did something athletic was when I jumped on a skateboard.  Man, that turned out *poorly.*

**Music:** No, I rarely play guitar these days, but I never was really that good anyway. Strange, when I used to play in Ybor I thought I was decent.  Decent is probably overstating at this point.  Loved that time of life though.

My newest favorite band fluctuates but [Jamestown Revival](https://jamestownrevival.com/) is up there with [the Lone Bellow](https://www.thelonebellow.com/).

**Likes:** bar-b-que.  Currently, a Kansas City Barbeque Society Certified BBQ Judge.  I have aspirations to compete but am hesitant to do so when I have new been on a team before.

**Dislikes:** Social media.  Horrendous.
