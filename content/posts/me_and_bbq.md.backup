## My history
When I was 17 years old, my friend Dale called me and asked if I wanted to work that evening.  I had a job... kinda.  I was working at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) but what the heck.  So, I drove over the Lupton's Fat Man's BBQ on 30th Street.

Starting out as a bus boy which included overseeing the salad bar, I learned a good many things.  Most importantly, how to use a knife.  Seriously, using a knife for food prep is a skill that I still use most days.

After about a year, I traded in my bus tray for a slicer and a spatula.  Learning how to make a fire, use the smoker, cook steak to order, split chickens, these are lessons I cherish.

## Cooking for lots of people
After a couple years, the Lupton's had me do catering.  Sometimes, small groups (small is about 125 people) but there were times when cooking for big groups meant working from dawn until close to midnight and then turning around and doing it all over again.  These big parties were 2,000 people eating ribs, chicken, baked beans, potato salad, cole slaw, garlic bread and whatever they ordered for drinks.  

Like most people who have worked in the restaurant/catering biz, you learn to manage your time efficient, problem solve, and working hard (real hard).

## Moving on
Most people move on from food service.  I was no different.  After getting a job in the soccer and then software, you settle into a more traditional career. But, you don't forget about the Q.  You eat at bbq joints but you are extremely critical 'cause YOU KNOW 'Q.  I have reviewed barbecue but I save my harshest criticism for my own bbq.  

## KCBS
I think it was about 15 years ago, I decided that if I was going to be ***this*** critical about barbecue, I better get some type of credential.  So, I joined the Kansas City Barbeque Society and took the class to become a KCBS Certified Barbeque Judge.  Frankly, I have judged a few times, but I am much more interested in making my own Q better.  More competitive.  

## My own Q
If you have either seen a competition like Pitmasters, you know the major barbeque categories are ribs, pulled pork, chicken and brisket.  Personally, I have been terrible at brisket until recently and now the tide has turned.  

I would say my current ranking quality 

I will start posting a bit more about recipes, equipment, wood fuel, and processes in future posts.

Until then, ***smell that smoke.***
