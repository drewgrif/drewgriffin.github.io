## Barbecue Sauce
![](../../images/bbq-sauce.jpg)

As you know, I love BBQ. Here is a sauce recipe.  The simple sauce is for my friends and family who do not enjoy heat while partaking in some delicious BBQ.  The Spicier sauce is more for the ladies and gents that like a little more kick to their BBQ experience.
Simple Sauce

	1 1/2 cups of ketchup
	1 cup of apple cider vinegar
	1/4 cup of Worcestershire sauce
	1/4 cup of soy sauce
	1 cup of packed dark brown sugar
	2 Tablespoons of chili powder
	2 cloves of minced garlic
	2 Tablespoons of vegetable oil
	3 slices of oranges

NOTE: I use a sauce pan, put the first two ingredients (ketchup and cider vinegar) and then put the pan on low while I add and mix the rest of the ingredients.  Once I am done and the creation is getting hot, I leave on simmer for 20 minutes or until I am ready.  DO NOT BURN BBQ SAUCE.
Spicier Options

Simple Sauce PLUS the following:

	2 additional Tablespoons of chili power
	1 teaspoon of ground ginger
	Dry mustard to taste


Competition Note:

Some people add honey to the sauce before submitting their entry to the judges.  Presumably, it offers a desirable glistening quality to the meat.  In my opinion it is not necessary but to each his own.
