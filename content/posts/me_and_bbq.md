## My history
When I was 17 years old, my friend Dale called me and asked if I wanted to work that evening.  I had a job... kinda.  I was working at the Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI) but what the heck.  So, I drove over the Lupton's Fat Man's BBQ on 30th Street.

Starting out as a bus boy which included overseeing the salad bar, I learned a good many things.  Most importantly, how to use a knife.  Seriously, using a knife for food prep is a skill that I still use most days.

After about a year, I traded in my bus tray for a slicer and a spatula.  Learning how to make a fire, use the smoker, cook steak to order, split chickens, these are lessons I cherish.

## Cooking for lots of people
After a couple years, the Lupton's had me do some catering.  Sometimes, small groups (small is about 125 people) but there were times when cooking for big groups meant working from dawn until close to midnight and then turning around and doing it all over again.  These big parties were 2,000 people eating ribs, chicken, baked beans, potato salad, cole slaw, garlic bread and whatever they ordered for drinks.
